InsCD, namely Instant Cognitive Diagnosis (Chinese: æ—¶è¯Š), is a highly modularized python library for cognitive diagnosis in intelligent education systems. This library incorporates both traditional methods (e.g., solving IRT via statistics) and deep learning-based methods (e.g., modelling students and exercises via graph neural networks).

## ðŸ“° News 
- [x] [2024.7.14] InsCD toolkit v1.0 is released and available for downloading.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Installation
Git and install with pip:
```
git clone https://github.com/ECNU-ILOG/inscd.git
cd [path of code]
pip install .
```
or install the library from pypi
```
pip install inscd
```
### Quick Example
The following code is a simple example of cognitive diagnosis implemented by inscd. We load build-in datasets, create cognitive diagnosis model, train model and show its performance:  
```python
from inscd.datahub import NeurIPS20
from inscd.models.neural import NCDM

listener.activate()
datahub = NeurIPS20()
datahub.random_split()
datahub.random_split(source="valid", to=["valid", "test"])

ncdm = NCDM()
ncdm.build(datahub)
ncdm.train(datahub, "train", "valid")

test_results = ncdm.score(datahub, "test", metrics=["acc", "doa"])
```
